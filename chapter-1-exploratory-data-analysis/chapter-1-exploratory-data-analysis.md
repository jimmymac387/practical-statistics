 - Add notes here

There are two basic types of structured data: numeric and categorical

### Key Terms for Data Types
 - ***Continuous (aka interval, float, numeric)*** - Data that can take on any value in an interval
 - ***Discrete (aka integer, count)*** - Data that can take on only integer values, such as counts
 - ***Categorical (aka factors, nominal)*** - Data that can take on only a specific set of values representing a set of possible categories
 - ***Binary (aka logical, boolean)*** - A special case of categorical data with just two categories of values
 - ***Ordinal (aka ordered factor)*** - Categorical data that has an explicit ordering

Data types help determine the type of visualization, data analysis, or statistical model that one chooses

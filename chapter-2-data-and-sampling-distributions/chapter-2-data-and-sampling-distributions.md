# Chapter 2: Data and Sampling Distributions

Sampling is an important tool for working efficiently with a variety of data and minimizing bias

Many real-life situations can be modeled by a coin flip, including buy or don't buy, fraud or no fraud, click or don't click, etc.

### Random Sampling and Sampling Bias
A *sample* is a subset of data from a larger dataset, which is called the *population*

##### Key terms
- ***Sample*** - A subset from a larger dataset
- ***Population*** - The larger dataset or idea of a dataset
- ***N (n)*** - The size of the population (size of sample)
- ***Random sampling*** - Drawing elements into a sample at random
- ***Stratified sampling*** - Dividing the population into strata and randomly sampling from each strata
- ***Simple random sample** - The sample that results from random sampling without stratifying the population
- ***Sample bias*** - A sample that misrepresents the population

Sampling can be done with or without replacement

Data quality is more important than quantity in data science and involves completeness, consistency of format, cleanliness, and accuracy of individual data points (i.e., a representative sample)

> **Example:** *Literary Digest* collected millions of samples and predicted Alf Landon would beat FDR because their sample was not representative (i.e., introduced sample bias). Gallup collected 2,000 high quality samples and correctly predicted victory for FDR.
